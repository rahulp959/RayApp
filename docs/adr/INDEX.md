## When to write an ADR

Write one whenever you:

- Choose between meaningful alternatives (libraries, protocols, patterns)
- Change the API / WebSocket protocol
- Change the navigation or state management strategy
- Change the build or CI/CD pipeline
- Introduce a persistence layer (SQLite, Postgres, etc.)
- Make a performance or security trade-off

## Filename convention

`docs/adr/NNNN-short-title.md` — four-digit, zero-padded (e.g. `0001-router-choice.md`)
